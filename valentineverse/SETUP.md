# 🚀 QUICK SETUP - READ THIS FIRST!

## Step 1: Add Your Videos

You need to add these 4 video files to this folder:

1. **cosmic-odds.mp4** (15 seconds)
2. **holiday-magic.mp4** (8 seconds)  
3. **early-years.mp4** (8 seconds)
4. **the-big-question.mp4** (15 seconds)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The filenames MUST match exactly (including lowercase)!

## Step 2: Add Background Music (Optional)

Add a file called **background-music.mp3** to this folder.

**Don't have music?** Here's where to get FREE Valentine's music:
- YouTube Audio Library: https://studio.youtube.com/
- Pixabay Music: https://pixabay.com/music/
- Incompetech: https://incompetech.com/

Search for: "romantic", "soft piano", "love", "valentine"

**Or skip music entirely** - the app works fine without it!

## Step 3: Test Locally

Open terminal/command prompt in this folder and run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open: http://localhost:8000

**Don't have Python?** Just use VS Code Live Server or deploy directly to Vercel.

## Step 4: Deploy Online

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up (free)
3. Click "Add New Project"
